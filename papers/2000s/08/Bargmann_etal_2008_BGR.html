<P>In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft proved the existence of cryovolcanism, i.e., the icy counterpart
of volcanism on Earth, on Saturn's moon Enceladus during its close fly-bys. In
particular, water-rich plume venting was discovered in the south polar region. Thus, Enceladus
was found to be one out of three outer solar bodies to be geologically active. This
contribution is concerned with the modelling and computation of this phenomenon. For
the underlying thermoelastic description of ice at cryogenic temperatures, we resort to
the Green-Naghdi approach. The Green-Naghdi theory includes the classical Fourier approach,
but, in addition to that, it is a lot more general as it also allows for other types
of heat propagation. The numerical implementation is carried out with the help of the
finite element method. Results show that lateral spreading of internal and surface warming
away from an active volcanic vent increases strongly with increasing contribution of
the non-classical heat flux. Agreement with available high-resolution surface temperature
data based on infrared spectrometry seems to be best if the non-classical heat flux contributes
significantly to the total heat transport. Complementary laboratory studies would
be required in order to strengthen this speculative, yet promising idea.</P>
