<P>We present an application of the newly developed CAFFE model
(Continuum-mechanical, Anisotropic Flow model based on an
anisotropic Flow Enhancement factor) to the EPICA ice core at
Kohnen Station, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (referred to as
the EDML core). A one-dimensional flow model for the site is
devised, which includes the anisotropic flow law and the fabric
evolution equation of the CAFFE model. Three different solution
methods are employed: (i) computing the ice flow based on the
flow law of the CAFFE model and the measured fabrics;
(ii) solving the CAFFE fabric evolution equation under the
simplifying assumption of transverse isotropy; and (iii) solving
the unrestricted CAFFE fabric evolution equation. Method (i)
demonstrates clearly the importance of the anisotropic fabric
in the ice column for the flow velocity. The anisotropic
enhancement factor produced with method (ii) agrees reasonably
well with that of method (i), even though the measured fabric
shows a girdle structure (which breaks the transverse isotropy)
in large parts of the ice core. For method (iii), we find that
the measured fabric is reproduced well by the model down to
~2100&nbsp;m depth. Systematic deviations at greater depths are
 attributed to the disregard of migration recrystallization
 in the model.</P>
