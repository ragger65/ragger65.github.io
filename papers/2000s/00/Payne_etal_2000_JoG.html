<P>This paper discusses results from the second phase of the European Ice Sheet
Modelling Initiative (EISMINT). It reports the intercomparison of ten
operational ice-sheet models and uses a series of experiments to examine
the implications of thermomechanical coupling for model behaviour. A schematic,
circular ice sheet is used in the work which investigates both steady states
and the response to stepped changes in climate.
The major finding is that the radial symmetry implied in the experimental
design can, under certain circumstances, break down with the formation of
distinct, regularly spaced spokes of cold ice which extended from the interior
of the ice sheet outward to the surrounding zone of basal melt.
These features also manifest themselves in the thickness and velocity
distributions predicted by the models. They appear to be a common feature
to all of the models which took part in the intercomparison, and may stem
from interactions between ice temperature, flow and surface form. The exact
nature of these features varies between models and their existence appears
to be controlled by the overall thermal regime of the ice sheet. A second
result is that there is considerable agreement between the models in their
predictions of global-scale response to imposed climate change.</P>
