<P>The modern dynamic and thermodynamic state of the entire Antarctic
ice sheet is computed as the result of a 242200 year paleoclimatic
simulation with the 3-d polythermal ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS. The
simulation is driven by a climate history derived from the Vostok ice
core and the SPECMAP sea-level record. In a 872&nbsp;x&nbsp;436&nbsp;km
region in western Dronning Maud Land (DML), where a deep ice core is
planned within the frame of the European Project for Ice Coring in
Antarctica (EPICA), new high-resolution bedrock and ice-thickness
data are implemented and a locally refined numerical grid is
applied, which goes beyond the predecessor of this study
(Calov et&nbsp;al., <I>Ann. Glaciol.</I>, <B>27</B>, 201-206, 1998).
The computed fields of basal temperature, age and shear
deformation together with the measured accumulation rates
give valuable information for the selection of a suitable drillsite
in accordance with the objective to obtain a high-resolution
climate record for the last glacial cycle. Based on these results,
a possible drillsite at 73°59'S, 00°00'E
is discussed, for which the computed depth profiles of temperature, age,
velocity and shear deformation are presented. The geographic origin of the
ice column at this position extends 1320&nbsp;km upstream and therefore
does not leave the DML region.</P>
