Continuum Mechanics and Applications in Geophysics and the Environment</H1>

<H3 style="color:#000000;">Preface</H3>

<P>This book is dedicated to Professor Kolumban Hutter of the Darmstadt
University of Technology on the occasion of his 60th birthday on
22 January 2001.</P>

<P>Professor Hutter graduated in Civil Engineering from the ETH Zurich,
and then worked in industry-related consulting at the
Institute of Mechanics and the Laboratory of Hydraulics and Soil
Mechanics at the ETH, before embarking on a PhD in Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics in Cornell University. He duly completed his PhD under the
supervision of Professor Y. H. Pao, working in the field of
the electrodynamics of continuous media. After his PhD, Professor Hutter
returned to Europe where he worked as a senior scientist at the
Laboratory for Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology, ETH Zurich, being
involved in glacier flow, physical limnology, avalanche research and
granular media. At the same time he maintained scientific contact with the
Mechanics Institute of the Vienna University of Technology. In both
European cities he received a habilitation degree: In Vienna for
Mechanics, in Zurich for Theoretical Glaciology and Limnology. Since
1987 Professor Hutter has been the successor to Professor Becker at the
Department of Mechanics, Darmstadt University of Technology.</P>

<P>Professor Hutter's work has always been relevant to real life, and a
feature of the man is his attention to experiments and matching
theory. He has built up an internationally respected laboratory in
Darmstadt which concentrates on both experimental and theoretical
aspects. Professor Hutter has become a renowned expert in ice physics
and glaciology, and his book on <I>Theoretical Glaciology</I> is one of
the most widely quoted in the field. For several years he was
Scientific Editor of the prestigious <I>Journal of Glaciology.</I> In
addition to glaciology, Professor Hutter has continued to produce
fundamental contributions in the electrodynamics of continuous media, and
to produce work of the finest calibre in the fields of soil mechanics,
porous media, granular flows, avalanche dynamics, climatology, and
lake physics. He is the Managing Editor of the journal <I>Continuum
Mechanics and Thermodynamics.</I></P>

<P>This volume represents a collection of articles in the field of
Professor Hutter's interests, namely applied continuum mechanics, soil
mechanics and porous media, glacier and ice dynamics, and climatology
and lake physics. The articles are by people well respected in their
fields, and it is a pleasure to honour Professor Hutter with this book.</P>
