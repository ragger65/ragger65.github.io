Glacial isostasy: Models for the response of the Earth to varying ice

<H4 style="color:#000000;">Abstract</H4>

<P>Two types of models for glacial isostasy, the response of the
body of the Earth to temporally varying ice loads, are reviewed. The first
class, referred to as "simple models", comprises a lithosphere and an
asthenosphere layer, the dynamics of which are parameterized in a simple
fashion. The lithosphere is treated either as locally responding or as a thin
elastic plate, the asthenosphere either as relaxing or as a viscous fluid in a
thin layer. The combinations of these approaches generate four different
variants of simple models. A physically more adequate description is achieved
by modelling the Earth as a self-gravitating, viscoelastic, n-layer (SGVE)
body, which reflects the structure of the Earth more realistically and allows
for a three-dimensional computation of the fields of displacement, stress,
density and gravity. The isostasy models are compared by coupled simulations
with a dynamic/thermodynamic model for the Antarctic ice sheet. It turns out
that, of the simple models, the lithosphere uplift pattern of the elastic
lithosphere/relaxing asthenosphere combination agrees best with the SGVE
result.</P>
