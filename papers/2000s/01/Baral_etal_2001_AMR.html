<P>A review is given of the theory of polythermal ice sheets, i.e., ice
masses of which the ice has submelting temperatures in certain
subdomains and is at the pressure melting point in other
subdomains. Cold ice is treated as a non-linearly viscous heat
conducting fluid, temperate ice as a mixture of ice at the melting
point and melt-water diffusing through the ice matrix. Cold and
temperate ice are separated by a non-material singular Stefan-type
surface. We repeat and partly amend the complicated field equations
and boundary conditions as derived in the literature. These
equations are subjected to a scale analysis that makes the creeping
flow conditions and the shallow geometries of land-based ice sheets
explicit. The small aspect ratio eps - typical depth to
horizontal distance over which the geometry or/and stresses change
appreciably - suggests a perturbation approach for a possible
analytical or numerical solution which has been pursued to include
second-order terms O(eps^2). The lowest-order O(eps^0) model equations,
known as the shallow-ice approximation (SIA),
are asymptotically valid in the entire ice sheet
domain except a small marginal zone provided the topographic
variations are shallow, i.e., possess wave height to wavelength
ratios that are O(eps^1) <I>and</I> the
constitutive relation for the stress deviator exhibits finite
viscosity at zero effective shear stress (square root of second
stress deviator invariant). We critically review earlier procedures
and put them into the proper perspectives with regard to the
original expansion procedures. We extend the zeroth-order theory to
first and second order but present only those equations and
deductions from them which lead to improved physical insight. In
particular we derive stress formulas which show how the stresses
depend on (i) depth and surface slope, (ii) surface topography and
(iii) stress deviator components, more complete than, and going beyond,
known formulas of the literature. Finally we discuss numerically
computed second-order stresses for the
present state of the Greenland ice sheet. It turns out that they are
typically three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding
zeroth-order quantities, and that they are mainly determined by
contributions due to zeroth-order stress deviators, rather than by
topography effects. Their relative importance is largest close to the ice
surface for the second-order pressure, and in the vicinity of ice domes
for the horizontal, bed-parallel shear stresses. There are 229 references.</P>
