<P>Two diagnostic, dynamic/thermodynamic ice-shelf models are
applied to the Brunt Ice Shelf/Stancomb-Wills Ice Tongue system,
located off Caird Coast, Coats Land, Antarctica. The Brunt
Ice Shelf/Stancomb-Wills Ice Tongue system is characterized as a
thin, unbounded ice shelf with an atypical and highly
heterogeneous structure. In contrast to other ice shelves, a
composite mass of icebergs that calved at the grounding line
and were then locked within fast (sea) ice exists between
the fast-moving Stancomb-Wills Ice Stream and the slow-moving
Brunt Ice Shelf. We simulate the present flow regime of the ice
shelf that results from the ice-thickness distribution and the
inflow at the grounding line with two different models, and
compare the model results with feature tracking and InSAR flow
velocities. We then incorporate two observed features, a rift
and a shear margin, into the models with two different approaches,
and demonstrate the effects of variations in numerical values
for the shear strength and viscosity in these zones on the
simulated velocity field. A major result is that both kinds of
implementation of the rifts lead to similar effects on the entire
velocity field, while there are discrepancies in the vicinity of
the rifts.</P>
