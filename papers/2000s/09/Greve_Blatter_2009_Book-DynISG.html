Dynamics of Ice Sheets and Glaciers</H1>

<P>Ralf GREVE and Heinz BLATTER</P>

<hr>

<H4 style="color:#000000;">Preface</H4>

<P>Ice sheets, ice shelves, ice caps and glaciers are active,
dynamic components of the climate system of the Earth, and they
deserve the same scientific attention as the atmosphere and the
oceans. However, while the dynamics of the atmosphere and the
oceans have been studied intensively and literature on these
topics abound, awareness of the importance of ice dynamics
within the big picture has increased only recently. Just as an
example, the widely acclaimed and valued book <I>Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics</I> by Pedlosky (1987) states that "the
subject has tended to focus on the dynamics of large-scale
phenomena in the atmosphere and the oceans", and,
consequently, only these are presented in the book. On the
other hand, <I>glaciology</I> is an established field of
research, and glacier dynamics has been dealt with in the
literature to some extent; however, with a certain focus on
smaller-scale phenomena. Treatments of the large-scale dynamics
of ice sheets are mainly found in the specialist literature.</P>

<P>In this book, we try to bridge the gap between the conventional
understandings of geophysical fluid dynamics and glacier
dynamics. Chapter&nbsp;1 puts the subject into the
wider context of climate research. In Chapter&nbsp;2,
the mathematical properties of vectors and tensors are reviewed
briefly. Chapter&nbsp;3 presents a solid,
continuum-mechanical background, which is the foundation for
the subject matter of the remainder of the book. This chapter
goes further than the immediate needs of ice sheet and glacier
dynamics in order to provide a framework applicable to a great
variety of related problems in geophysics (including the
above-mentioned large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere and the
ocean), physics and engineering sciences. The material
properties of polycrystalline ice, as it occurs in land ice
masses on Earth, are discussed in
Chapter&nbsp;4. The core of this book is made
up by Chapters&nbsp;5-7,
devoted to the dynamics of ice sheets, ice shelves and
glaciers, respectively. Special emphasis is put on
systematically developing hierarchies of approximations for the
different systems, and suitable numerical solution techniques
are discussed. Chapter&nbsp;8 is concerned with
simple models for glacial isostasy, the reaction of the solid
Earth to temporally varying ice loads. In
Chapter&nbsp;9 some more advanced and demanding
topics of current research related to ice dynamics (induced
anisotropy, compressible firn, polythermal glaciers) are
treated. Chapter&nbsp;10 concludes the book.</P>

<P>The content is based, largely, on lectures about
ice-sheet/glacier dynamics and numerical models in glaciology
developed by the authors over the past years. These lectures
are offered jointly at the Hokkaido University, Sapporo, and
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, in
association with the International Antarctic Institute (IAI),
an international, multi-campus programme in cryosphere science
education

<A HREF="http://www.iai.utas.edu.au/">http://www.iai.utas.edu.au/</A>).
The level of treatment caters
mainly to graduate students, post-graduate students and
researchers, but most of the material should also be
understandable for motivated upper-level undergraduate
students.</P>

<P>In order to eliminate one source of distraction especially for
student readers, we have refrained from giving detailed
references to original literature in the style of scientific
articles. Instead, references have been kept at a reasonable
minimum, and whenever possible, overview articles and textbooks
have been given preference. An exception is
Chapter&nbsp;9, in which less well established
topics are discussed, and which is more biased by the authors'
own perspective than the material in the preceding chapters.
The literature list at the end of the book is also understood
as a suggestion for supplemental and/or further-reaching
reading. We apologize to those colleagues whose publications
are not quoted.</P>

<P>Hutter and J&ouml;hnk (2004) end the preface of their book
<I>Continuum Methods of Physical Modeling</I> with the
statement that "writing a book can never be finished, a book
has to be abandoned!" We cannot put it in better words.
Abandoning this book is what we are now going to do, well
knowing that it is not perfect, but nevertheless hoping that a
variety of readers with backgrounds in glaciology, climate
science, geophysical fluid dynamics, continuum mechanics,
physics and applied mathematics will find it useful and
inspiring in the years to come.</P>
