<P>The flow of the north polar cap of Mars, which are
assumed to consist mainly of H2O ice, is investigated with the
three-dimensional ice-sheet model 'SICOPOLIS'. We consider a
simplified topography and a climatic forcing varying between the
present state and warmer, more humid conditions in the past with an
obliquity cycle of 1.3 million earth years (yr). Furthermore,
SICOPOLIS is coupled with the three-layer viscoelastic ground
model 'displace' to simulate the isostatic response of the
underlying lithosphere/mantle system. Likely ice-flow velocities at
present are a few mm/yr, along with surface accumulation/ablation
rates of the order of 0.1&nbsp;mm water&nbsp;equiv./yr and basal temperatures
more than 50°C below pressure melting. Thicknesses of the
rheological lithosphere of 50-400&nbsp;km are consistent with geothermal
heat fluxes of 15-36&nbsp;mW/m2, with some evidence for
values of ca. 80-120&nbsp;km and 20-30&nbsp;mW/m2,
respectively. For an Earth-like upper-mantle viscosity of
O(10^21&nbsp;Pa&nbsp;s), relaxation times of the
lithosphere/mantle system are much shorter than significant load
changes, so that the mantle behaves as an inviscid fluid. The poor
correlation between the computed and measured free-air gravity signal
indicates that it is determined by mass anomalies of a different
origin.</P>
