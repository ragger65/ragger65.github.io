<P>Specimens from ice cores of polar ice sheets (Greenland, Antarctica)
allow determination of the past climate of the Earth by determination
of the isotopic composition of the water molecules and examination of
the air trapped in included pores. This requires assigning
simultaneously the age to an ice specimen taken from a certain depth
("dating"), which can be achieved either by several stratigraphic
methods or by computer simulations of the creeping motion of the ice
with a suitable model.</P>

<P>The motion of the ice in polar ice sheets is similar to the spreading
of honey on the breakfast plate. Rheologically, the ice is regarded as
a very viscous, thermo-mechanically coupled power-law fluid which
shows a gravitationally induced creeping flow. At the free surface
this ice mass is subject to the climatic forcing which encompasses
temperature variations of the atmosphere, accumulation of snow due to
precipitation and ablation of ice due to melting. Because of the ice
load, the solid earth beneath the ice deforms as well, but it equally
serves as a heat source via the geothermal heat flux. This complex
initial-boundary-value problem is discussed together with its
difficulties. Solutions are presented for paleoclimatic
reconstructions of the Greenland ice sheet along with the resulting
datings for the central-Greenlandic ice cores GRIP and GISP2.</P>
