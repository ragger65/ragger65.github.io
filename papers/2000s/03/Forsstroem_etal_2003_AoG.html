<P>In order to reconstruct the paleo-glaciation in Fennoscandia and
northern Asia during the late Weichselian ice age phase, simulations
with the dynamic and thermodynamic ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS are
carried out. Our focus is on the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) around
20&nbsp;ka&nbsp;BP. Climate forcing is based on mean annual surface
temperature and precipitation derived from present data and PMIP
UKMO21 results for the LGM. These distributions are interpolated via a
glacial index defined by the GRIP delta-18-O record. The extent of the
Scandinavian and the Barents ice sheets are reproduced in good
agreement with the QUEEN reconstruction, but the Kara Sea and Taymyr
Peninsula areas are too excessively glaciated. The fast-flow regions
derived from the simulations, which are generally connected to regions
with a temperate base and temperate ice above, are compared to
hypothesized paleo-ice-stream locations, especially in the Norwegian
Channel and the Baltic area. In the Norwegian Channel, temperate basal
conditions with temperate ice above prevail and favour fast flow. In
the Baltic area, ice-sheet advance is generally accompanied by slow
ice velocities (under 200 m/a). Some temporary fast-flow features occur
due to transitional temperate-base conditions, and higher velocities
arise in retreat phases.</P>
