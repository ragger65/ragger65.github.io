The polar ice caps of Mars</H2>

<P>Both Martian polar regions are covered by prominent ice caps.
Similar to snow on Earth, the seasonal caps are extended layers
of CO2 frost which grow and shrink over the seasons. In the
respective summer season, much smaller permanent caps remain,
which are underlain by 3&nbsp;km high topographic domes termed as
polar layered deposits. The polar layered deposits consist
mainly of H2O ice and have formed by exchange of water with
the atmosphere over at least millions of years. Alternating
layers of clear and dusty ice, which are exposed in surface
troughs and close to the margin, indicate a complex climatic
history of Mars driven by quasi-periodic changes of orbital
elements, similar to the Milankovitch cycles on Earth. Likely
present-day glacial flow velocities are of the order of
0.1-1&nbsp;mm/a, the north polar deposits being
more dynamic than the southern ones due to higher surface
temperatures. Basal temperatures are far below the pressure
melting point, with the possible exception of geothermally
active areas under the ice.</P>
