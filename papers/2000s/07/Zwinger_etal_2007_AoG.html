<P>The Gorshkov crater glacier at Ushkovsky volcano, Kamchatka, is
characterised by a large aspect ratio and special thermodynamic
conditions at the bedrock caused by a locally enhanced and spatially
strongly varying geothermal heat flux. Furthermore, large parts of
this glacier consist of firn rather than pure ice, which alters the
rheological properties (viscosity, compressibility) of the glacier.
We present a newly developed, thermo-mechanically coupled,
three-dimensional flow model based on the finite-element (FE)
package Elmer, and apply it to the Gorshkov crater glacier. By
assuming steady-state conditions, the present-day velocity field,
temperature field, basal melting rate and age distribution are
simulated. We find that flow velocities are generally small (10's of
centimeters per year). Horizontal and vertical velocities are of
comparable magnitude, which shows that the shallow-ice approximation
is not applicable. Owing to the spatially variable volcanic heat
flux, the thermal regime at the ice base is cold in the deeper parts
of the glacier and temperate in the shallower parts. The measured
temperature profile and age horizons at the K2 borehole are
reproduced quite well, and remaining discrepancies may be attributed
to transient (non-steady-state) conditions. Firn compressibility is
identified as a crucial element for the modelling approach.</P>
