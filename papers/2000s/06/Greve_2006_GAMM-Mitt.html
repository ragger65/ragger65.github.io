<P>The role of water ice in the solar system is reviewed from a
fluid-dynamical point of view. On Earth and Mars, water ice forms
ice sheets, ice caps and glaciers at the surface, which show glacial
flow under their own weight. By contrast, water ice is a major
constituent of the bulk volume of the icy satellites in the outer
solar system, and ice flow can occur as thermal convection. The
rheology of polycrystalline aggregates of ordinary, hexagonal
ice&nbsp;Ih is described by a power law, different forms of which are
discussed. The temperature dependence of the ice viscosity follows an
Arrhenius law. Therefore, the flow of ice in a planetary environment
constitutes a thermo-mechanically coupled problem; its model
equations are obtained by inserting the flow law and the
thermodynamic material equations in the balance laws of mass,
momentum and energy. As an example of gravity-driven flow, the polar
caps of Mars are discussed.  For the north-polar cap, large-scale
flow velocities of the order of 0.1...1&nbsp;mm/a
are likely, locally enhanced by a factor ten or more in the vicinity
of surface scarps/troughs. By contrast, the colder south-polar cap
is expected to be almost stagnant. Tidally heated convection is
discussed for the example of the icy crust of Europa, where a
two-dimensional model predicts the formation of an upper, conductive
lid and a lower, convective layer with flow velocities of the order
of 100&nbsp;mm/a. Very little is known about the
fluid-dynamical relevance of high-pressure phases of water ice as
well as ices made up of other materials.</P>
