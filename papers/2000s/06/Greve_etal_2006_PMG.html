<P>The three-dimensional, dynamic/thermodynamic ice-sheet model
SICOPOLIS (SImulation COde for POLythermal Ice Sheets) is applied to
the ISMIP HEINO (Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project - Heinrich
Event INtercOmparison) set-up. ISMIP HEINO has been designed to
study large-scale ice-sheet instabilities, similar to those of the
Laurentide ice sheet which are the cause of Heinrich events, on a
simplified geometry which consists of a flat square with 4000&nbsp;km
side length. This square contains an area which resembles Hudson Bay
and Hudson Strait, on which rapid sediment sliding can occur. The
ice sheet is built up over 200&nbsp;ka by assuming a temporally constant
glacial climate. For the standard set-up of ISMIP HEINO, we obtain
an oscillatory behaviour of the ice sheet with a main period of
approx. 7.5&nbsp;ka. One cycle consists of a gradual growth phase,
followed by a massive surge through "Hudson Bay" and "Hudson
Strait" owing to rapid sediment sliding on a molten bed. The
occurrence of internal oscillations is robust against moderate
variations of the surface boundary conditions and the strength of
the sediment sliding. These findings support the idea of a free
oscillatory mechanism as the main cause for large-scale ice-sheet
surges.</P>
