<P>Crevasse patterns are the writings in a glacier's history book - the
movement, strain and deformation frozen in ice. Therefore by analysis
of crevasse patterns we can learn about the ice-dynamic processes
which the glacier has experienced.  Direct measurement of ice movement
and deformation is time-consuming and costly, in particular for large
glaciers; typically, observations are lacking when sudden changes
occur.  Analysis of crevasse patterns provides a means to reconstruct
past and ongoing deformation processes quantitatively.  This is
especially important for fast-moving ice.</P>

<P>Ice movement and deformation are commonly described and analyzed using
continuum mechanics and measurements of ice velocities or strain
rates.  Here, we present a different approach to the study of ice
deformation based on principles of structural geology. Fast ice
movement manifests itself in the occurrence of crevasses. Because
crevasses remain after the deformation event and may be transported,
overprinted or closed, their analysis based on aerial videography and
photography or satellite data gives information on past deformation
events and resulting strain states. In our treatment, we distinguish
(A) continuously fast-moving glaciers and ice streams, and (B)
surge-type glaciers, based on observations of two prototypes, (A)
Jakobshavn Isbrae , Greenland, and (B) Bering Glacier, Alaska, during
the 1993-1995 surge.</P>

<P>Classes of ice-deformation types are derived from aerial images of ice
surfaces using structural glaciology. For each type, the deformation
gradient matrix is formed. Relationships between invariants used in
structural geology and continuum mechanics and the singular value
decomposition are established and applied to ice-surface
classification.</P>

<P>Deformation during a surge is mostly one of the extensional
deformation types.  Continuously, or infinitesimally repeated,
deformation acting in continuously fast-moving ice causes typical
crevasse patterns. The structural-geology approach also includes a way
to treat the problem of shear, as observed in the margins of
fast-moving ice streams in slow-moving surrounding ice.  In this paper
we provide a first link between a physical analysis of ice-surface
deformation and a connectionist-geostatistical analysis of the same
problem.</P>
