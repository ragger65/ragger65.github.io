<P>Celestial-mechanical computations show that, even stronger than for
Earth, Mars is subject to Milankovic cycles, that is, quasi-periodic
variations of the orbital parameters obliquity, eccentricity and
precession. Consequently, solar insolation varies on time-scales of
10^4-10^5 years. It has long been supposed that this entails
climatic cycles like the terrestrial glacial-interglacial cycles. This
hypothesis is supported by the light-dark layered deposits of the
north- and south-polar caps indicating a strongly varying dust content
of the ice due to varying climate conditions in the past. This study
aims at simulating the dynamic and thermodynamic evolution of the
north-polar cap (NPC) of Mars with the ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS. The
boundary conditions of surface accumulation, ablation and temperature
are derived directly from the solar-insolation history by applying the
newly developed Mars Atmosphere-Ice Coupler MAIC. We consider
steady-state scenarios under present climate conditions as well as
transient scenarios over climatic cycles. It is found that the NPC is
very probably not in steady state with the present climate. The
topography of the NPC is mainly controlled by the history of the
surface mass balance. Ice flow, which is of the order of
1&nbsp;mm/a, plays only a minor role. In order to build up
the present cap during the last five million years of relatively low
obliquities, a present accumulation rate of
>=&nbsp;0.25 mm water equiv./a is required.
Computed basal temperatures are far below pressure melting for all
simulations and all times.</P>
