<P>The Eurasian Weichselian glaciation is studied with the SICOPOLIS
ice-sheet model and UKMO PMIP climate anomaly forcings. A set of
sensitivity tests are completed, including runs in  cold-ice mode,
different positive-degree-day (PDD) factors and modified climatic
data-sets. The model set-up with present-day climatology modified by
a glacial index brings forth an areally correct Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM) extent in the western areas, but the ice-sheet volume is too
small compared to reconstructions from rebound rates. Applying
modified climate data results in similar extent as indicated by the
Quaternary Environment of the Eurasian North (QUEEN) Late Weichselian
ice-sheet reconstruction. The simulation results display freshwater
fluxes from melting and calving in phase with Heinrich events H3 at
27, H2 at 22, and H1 at 14&nbsp;ka ago. These peaks correspond to fast
flow areas, with main activity at 27 and 22&nbsp;ka ago in the Nordic
Channel area and later in the Bear Island and Storfjorden region.
The activity of these areas seems to be shifting from south to north
from LGM to the Holocene. The freshwater pulse at 19&ndash;18.5&nbsp;ka could
correspond to Dansgaard&ndash;Oeschger oscillation, as well as ice volume
flux peaks around 18&ndash;17&nbsp;ka ago on the western margin of the ice
sheet.</P>
