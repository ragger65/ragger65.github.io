Relation of measured basal temperatures and the spatial distribution of the

<P>The thermomechanical, three-dimensional ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS
is applied to the Greenland ice sheet. Simulations over two
glacial-interglacial cycles are carried out, driven by a climatic
forcing interpolated between present conditions and
Last Glacial Maximum anomalies.
Based on the global heat-flow representation by
Pollack et&nbsp;al. (1993), we attempt to constrain the spatial
pattern of the geothermal heat flux by comparing simulation
results to direct measurements of basal temperatures at the
GRIP, NorthGRIP, Camp Century and Dye&nbsp;3 ice-core locations. The
obtained heat-flux map shows an increasing trend from west to east,
a high-heat-flux anomaly around NorthGRIP with values up to
135&nbsp;mW/m2 and a low-heat-flux anomaly around Dye&nbsp;3 with
values down to 20&nbsp;mW/m2. Validation is provided by the generally
good fit between observed and measured ice thicknesses. Residual
discrepancies are most likely due to deficiencies of the input
precipitation rate and further variability of the geothermal heat
flux not captured here.</P>
