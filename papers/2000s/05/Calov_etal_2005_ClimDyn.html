<P>We study the mechanisms of glacial inception by using the Earth
system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2, which
encompasses dynamic modules of the atmosphere, ocean, biosphere
and ice sheets. Ice-sheet dynamics are described by the
3-dimensional polythermal ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS. We have
performed transient experiments starting at the Eemiam
interglacial, at 126&nbsp;kyr&nbsp;BP (126,000 years before
present). The model runs for 26,000 years with time-dependent
orbital and CO2 forcings. The model simulates a rapid expansion of
the area covered by inland ice in the Northern Hemisphere,
predominantly over Northern America, starting at about
117&nbsp;kyr&nbsp;BP. During the next 7&nbsp;kyr, the ice volume
grows gradually in the model at a rate which corresponds to a
change in sea level of 10&nbsp;m per millennium. We have shown
that the simulated glacial inception represents a bifurcation
transition in the climate system from an interglacial to a glacial
state caused by the strong snow-albedo feedback. This transition
occurs when summer insolation at high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere drops below a threshold value, which is only slightly
lower than modern summer insolation. By performing longterm
equilibrium runs, we find that for the present-day orbital
parameters at least two different equilibrium states of the
climate system exist &ndash; the glacial and interglacial; however, for
the low summer insolation corresponding to 115&nbsp;kyr&nbsp;BP we
find only one, glacial, equilibrium state, while for the high
summer insolation corresponding to 126&nbsp;kyr&nbsp;BP only an
interglacial state exists in the model.</P>
