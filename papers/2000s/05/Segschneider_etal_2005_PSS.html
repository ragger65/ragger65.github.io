<P>A climate model of intermediate complexity, named the Mars
Climate Simulator, has been developed based on the Portable
University Model of the Atmosphere (PUMA). The main goal of this
new development is to simulate the climate variations on Mars
resulting from the changes in orbital parameters and their impact
on the layered polar terrains (also knows as permanent polar ice
caps). As a first step towards transient simulations over several
obliquity cycles, the model is applied to simulate the dynamical
and thermodynamical response of the Martian climate system to
different but fixed obliquity angles. The model is forced by the
annual and daily cycle of solar insolation. Experiments have been
performed for obliquities of phi=15° (minimum), phi=25.2°
(present) and phi=35° (maximum). The resulting changes in solar
insolation mainly in the polar regions impact strongly on the
cross equatorial circulation which is driven by the meridional
temperature gradient and steered by the Martian topography. At
high obliquity, the cross equatorial near surface flow from the
winter to the summer hemisphere is strongly enhanced compared to
low obliquity periods. The summer ground temperature ranges from
200&nbsp;K (phi=15°) to 250&nbsp;K (phi=35°) at 80°N in northern
summer, and from 220&nbsp;K (phi=15°) to 270&nbsp;K (phi=35°) at
80°S in southern summer. In the atmosphere at 1&nbsp;km above
ground, the respective range is 195&nbsp;K to 225&nbsp;K in
northern summer, and 210&nbsp;K to 250&nbsp;K in southern
summer.</P>
