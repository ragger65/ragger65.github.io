north-polar cap of Mars</H2>

<P>The evolution and dynamics of the north-polar cap
(residual-ice-cap/layered-deposits complex) of Mars is simulated with
a thermomechanical ice-sheet model. We consider a scenario with
ice-free initial conditions at 5&nbsp;Ma before present due to the
large obliquities which prevailed prior to this time. The north-polar
cap is then built up to its present shape, driven by a parameterized
climate forcing (surface temperature, surface mass balance) based on
the obliquity and eccentricity history. The effects of different ice
rheologies and different dust contents are investigated. It is found
that the build-up scenarios require an accumulation rate of
approximately 0.15-0.2&nbsp;mm/a at present. The topography evolution
is essentially independent of the ice dynamics due to the slow ice
flow. Owing to the uncertainties associated with the ice rheology and
the dust content, flow velocities can only be predicted within a range
of two orders of magnitude. Likely present values are of the order of
0.1-1&nbsp;mm/a, and a strong variation over the climatic cycles is
found. For all cases, computed basal temperatures are far below
pressure melting.</P>
