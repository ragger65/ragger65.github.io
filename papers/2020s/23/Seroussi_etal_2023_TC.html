<p>The Antarctic Ice Sheet represents the largest source of
uncertainty in future sea level rise projections, with a contribution
to sea level by 2100 ranging from &minus;5 to 43&nbsp;cm of sea level
equivalent under high carbon emission scenarios estimated by the
recent Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). ISMIP6
highlighted the different behaviors of the East and West Antarctic ice
sheets, as well as the possible role of increased surface mass balance
in offsetting the dynamic ice loss in response to changing oceanic
conditions in ice shelf cavities. However, the detailed contribution
of individual glaciers, as well as the partitioning of uncertainty
associated with this ensemble, have not yet been investigated. Here,
we analyze the ISMIP6 results for high carbon emission scenarios,
focusing on key glaciers around the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and we
quantify their projected dynamic mass loss, defined here as mass loss
through increased ice discharge into the ocean in response to changing
oceanic conditions. We highlight glaciers contributing the most to sea
level rise, as well as their vulnerability to changes in oceanic
conditions. We then investigate the different sources of uncertainty
and their relative role in projections, for the entire continent and
for key individual glaciers. We show that, in addition to Thwaites and
Pine Island glaciers in West Antarctica, Totten and Moscow University
glaciers in East Antarctica present comparable future dynamic mass
loss and high sensitivity to ice shelf basal melt. The overall
uncertainty in additional dynamic mass loss in response to changing
oceanic conditions, compared to a scenario with constant oceanic
conditions, is dominated by the choice of ice sheet model, accounting
for 52% of the total uncertainty of the Antarctic dynamic mass loss in
2100. Its relative role for the most dynamic glaciers varies between
14% for MacAyeal and Whillans ice streams and 56% for Pine Island
Glacier at the end of the century. The uncertainty associated with the
choice of climate model increases over time and reaches 13% of the
uncertainty by 2100 for the Antarctic Ice Sheet but varies between 4%
for Thwaites Glacier and 53% for Whillans Ice Stream. The uncertainty
associated with the ice-climate interaction, which captures different
treatments of oceanic forcings such as the choice of melt
parameterization, its calibration, and simulated ice shelf geometries,
accounts for 22% of the uncertainty at the ice sheet scale but reaches
36% and 39% for Institute Ice Stream and Thwaites Glacier,
respectively, by 2100. Overall, this study helps inform future
research by highlighting the sectors of the ice sheet most vulnerable
to oceanic warming over the 21st century and by quantifying the main
sources of uncertainty.</p>
