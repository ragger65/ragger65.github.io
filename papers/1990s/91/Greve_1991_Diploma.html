<P>This paper deals with the theoretical, numerical
and experimental treatment of two- and three-dimensional flow
avalanches. A depth-averaged theory for three-dimensional flow
avalanches is introduced, basing upon a MOHR-COULOMB yield criterion
and a COULOMB dry friction law, and the specialization to two dimensions
is carried out. The three-dimensional model equations are
width-averaged in a further step in order to receive equations that
can more easily be numerically handled. Furthermore, numerical
calculation schemes are given for the two- and three-dimensional model
equations, making use of material cells that follow the motion of the
avalanche.</P>

<P>Experiments are carried out with different granular
materials in a chute with a partly convex, partly concave curved
geometry. In these experiments the avalanche motion from the moment
of release to its standstill is followed by high speed
photography. The results are compared with numerical calculations in
order to get information about the applicability of the
model. Moreover, experiments are performed on a surface without
constraining walls, consisting of an inclined and a horizontal plane
connected by a curved area. These experiments are followed by
stereoscopic high speed photography, for which a mirror attachment,
constructed during this work, is applied. The photogrammetric
evaluation of the photos with the aim of obtaining relief maps as time
series could not be accomplished, but the applicability of this
method is demonstrated in principle by using a calibration body.</P>

<P>In case of two-dimensional avalanches a very good correspondence between
experiment and theory is observed. Even the development of the
detailed avalanche geometry can be reproduced in good agreement by
the model. In case of three-dimensional avalanches, however, the model
produces a considerable overprediction of the length and an
underprediction of the width of the avalanche body in comparison
with the experiment; a fact indicating that too much information of
the motion process is lost because of the width-averaging of the model
equations.</P>
