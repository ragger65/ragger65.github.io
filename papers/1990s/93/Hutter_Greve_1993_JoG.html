<P>This paper is concerned with the motion of an unconfined finite mass
of granular material down an inclined plane when released from a rest
position in the shape of a circular or elliptical paraboloid. The
granular mass is treated as a frictional Coulomb-like continuum with a
constant angle of internal friction. The basal friction force is
assumed to be composed of a Coulomb-type component with a bed-friction
angle that is position-dependent and a viscous Voellmy-type resistive
stress that is proportional to the velocity squared. The model
equations are those of Hutter and others (in press b) and form a
spatially two-dimensional set for the evolution of the avalanche
height and the depth-averaged in-plane velocity components; they hold
for a motion of a granular mass along a <I>plane</I> surface.</P>

<P><I>Similarity</I> solutions, i.e., solutions which preserve the shape
and the structure of the velocity field, are constructed by
decomposing the motion into that of the centre of mass and the
deformation relative to it. This decomposition is possible provided
the effect of the Voellmy drag on the deformation is ignored. With it,
the depth and velocities relative to those of the centre of mass of
the moving pile can be determined analytically. It is shown that the
pile has a parabolic cap shape and contour lines are elliptical. The
semi-axes and the position and velocity of the center of mass are
calculated numerically. We explicitly show that</P>

<LI>For two-dimensional spreading, a rigid-body motion does not
exist, no matter what the values of the bed-friction angle and the
coefficient of viscous drag.</LI>
<LI>A steady final velocity of the centre of the mass cannot be
assumed, but the motion of the centre of mass depends strongly on the
value of the Voellmy coefficient.</LI>
<LI>The geometry of the moving pile depends on the variation of the
bed-friction angle with position, as well as on the value of the
coefficient of viscous drag.</LI>
