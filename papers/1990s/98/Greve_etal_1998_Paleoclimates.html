Palaeoclimatic evolution and present conditions of the Greenland Ice Sheet
in the vicinity of Summit: An approach by large-scale modelling</H2>

<P>Using the three-dimensional numerical model SICOPOLIS for polythermal
land-based ice sheets in the shallow ice approximation, simulations are
performed to determine the velocity, temperature and water-content
distributions as well as the evolution of the free surface, the
cold-temperate-transition surface (CTS) and the basal surface within the
Greenland Ice Sheet through time for a climate driving as determined by the
(smoothed) GRIP palaeotemperature record. The model is driven by the
temperature at the free surface, the global sea level and the geothermal
heat flow 5 km below the basal surface. It uses plausible parameterizations
for the accumulation rate (snowfall minus melting), the basal sliding law
and the constitutive behaviour (power-law rheology), in which the
fluidity difference between glacial and interglacial ice is accounted for by
appropriate enhancement factors.</P>

<P>Computations that cover 250,000 years of climate history are performed
with various sets of parameters to find optimal present conditions when
compared with available data. To this end a misfit index is defined, and
parameterizations are chosen so as to minimize it. It is shown that dating
the ice at depth is crucially dependent on the "flux of age" into
the base. However, other parameterizations such as the geothermal heat flow
or the basal drag in the sliding law etc. equally influence the present
geometry of the ice sheet.</P>

<P>We investigate the results of the best-fit simulation with particular
attention to the vicinity of Summit, the highest point of the Greenland Ice
Sheet at 72°34'N, 37°38'W, in whose
vicinity the two deep ice cores GRIP and GISP2 were drilled. For these
boreholes, time series for the ice thickness and the basal temperature,
present temperature-depth profiles and present age-depth profiles are
presented. Furthermore, the ice-surface topography and the ice thickness in
the vicinity of Summit is shown, and a comparison with high-resolution RES
data is performed.</P>
