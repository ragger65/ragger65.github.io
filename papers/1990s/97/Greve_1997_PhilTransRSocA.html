A continuum-mechanical formulation for shallow polythermal ice sheets</H2>

<P>This paper is concerned with a new theoretical approach to model
grounded ice sheets in three dimensions. These are considered as
polythermal, i.e., there will
be regions with temperatures below the pressure melting point ("cold
ice") and regions with temperatures exactly at the pressure
melting point ("temperate ice"). In the latter, small quantities of
water may occur.</P>

<P>Based on previous approaches, an improved theory of polythermal ice
sheets is developed, which is founded on continuum-thermodynamic
balance relations and jump conditions for mass, momentum and
energy. The rheological behaviour is assumed to be that of an
incompressible, nonlinear viscous and heat conducting fluid; because
of the dependence of viscosity on temperature and on water content, the
problem is thermo-mechanically coupled. After presenting analytic
solutions for a simple geometry (ice sheet of uniform depth), the
theory is subjected to a scaling procedure with the assumptions of a
small aspect ratio (ratio between typical vertical dimension and
typical horizontal dimension) and a small Froude number. This leads to
the introduction of the polythermal shallow-ice approximation (SIA)
equations. </P>

<P>Finally, as an application of the model to a real problem,
a numerically computed steady-state solution for the
Greenland Ice Sheet under present climate conditions is presented
and compared with the real ice sheet.</P>
