<P>In this paper the agreement between laboratory experiments performed with
three-dimensional granular avalanches moving along a partly curved
surface and their numerical predictions shall be examined. First,  the most
important elements of the theory describing the flow of a
cohesionless granular material down a rough bed are presented. Based on the
depth-averaged model equations, an advanced numerical integration scheme is
developped by making use of a Lagrangian representation (i.e., the grid moves
with the deforming pile) and a finite difference approximation that
handles the numerically two-dimensional problem accurately.
Second, experiments are described that were conducted with a finite mass of
granular material moving down, respectively, an inclined plane and
a surface consisting of an inclined and a
horizontal plane connected by a curved transition area; the initial geometry
of the avalanche is generated by a spherical cap. Third, for
a number of different
experiments a comparison is carried out between the experimentally determined
positions of the granular avalanche during its motion and the  numerical
prediction of these positions. It shows that the numerical results fit the
experimental data surprisingly well.</P>
