<P>This thesis is concerned with the theoretical, analytical and numerical
modelling of grounded ice sheets in three dimensions. These are considered as
polythermal, i.e., it is accounted for the fact that there may be regions with
temperatures below the pressure melting point ("cold ice") as well as regions
with temperatures exactly on the pressure melting point ("temperate ice"). In
the latter, small quantities of water may occur in addition.</P>

<P>Based on previous approaches, an improved theory of polythermal ice sheets is
developed, which is founded on continuum-thermodynamic balance relations and
jump conditions for mass, momentum and energy. The rheologic behaviour is
hereby assumed to follow an incompressible,
nonlinear viscous and heat conducting
fluid; because of the dependence of viscosity on temperature and water content
the problem is thermo-mechanically coupled. After giving analytic solutions for
a simple geometry (parallel-sided ice slab), the theory is subjected to a
scaling procedure with the assumptions of a small aspect ratio (ratio between
typical vertical dimension and typical horizontal dimension) and a small Froude
number. This leads to the introduction of the polythermal shallow-ice
approximation (SIA) equations.</P>

<P>Subsequently, a numerical solution scheme for these equations is given, making
use of a finite difference approach. In the vertical,
the model domain is mapped
onto the unit interval in order to make the implementation of boundary
conditions easier. Using the computer code developed from this, model runs
for two different problems are carried out. First, the EISMINT ice sheet is
dealt with, consisting of a flat square-shaped bedrock subject to spatially
uniform snowfall. Second, simulations for the Greenland ice sheet are
discussed, that were carried out for both steady state conditions and
time-dependent scenarios, namely sinusoidal variations, a realistic climate
history deduced from ice core reconstruction, and increased temperatures due to
intensified greenhouse warming. </P>
