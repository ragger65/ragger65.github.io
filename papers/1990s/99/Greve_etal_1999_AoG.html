<P>High resolution (TIMS) U-series dating of sea level events obtained
from coral reef complexes has suggested that the global deglaciation
from the Saale (penultimate) glacial to the Eem interglacial (marine
delta-O18 stages 6/5) may have occured earlier in
relation to Milankovitch insolation forcing than that from the
Wisconsin glacial to the Holocene interglacial (marine
delta-O18 stages 2/1). However, the interpretation of these
data have been problematic because of the possibility of isotope
exchange. In order to investigate whether these different lead/lag
relations between Milankovitch forcing and ice volume are feasible
from the point of view of large-scale ice-sheet dynamics and
thermodynamics, the 3-d polythermal ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS is
applied to the entire northern hemisphere (which gives the major
contribution to global ice volume changes due to the relative
stability of the Antarctic ice sheet), and simulations through
the two last climatic cycles are conducted. The simulations cover the
time interval from 250 ka BP until today and are driven by
surface-temperature reconstructions of deep ice cores (GRIP, Vostok)
and simple parameterizations for the change of precipitation with
time. Discussion of the results is focussed on the Saale/Eem and the
Wisconsin/Holocene transitions. The amount and rate of deglaciation
are in good agreement with the SPECMAP record for both cases, and
the evidence of the data for an early start of the Eem interglacial
is supported.</P>
