<P>The application of two different methods for the computation of the age
of ice is discussed within the frame of numerical ice sheet
modelling. The first method solves the purely advective equation for the
age field in the Eulerian frame, which
requires the addition of a numerical diffusion term to stabilize the solution
and therefore produces arbitrary results in a near-basal boundary layer.
The second method makes more efficient use of the simplicity of the
equation in the Lagrangian frame by tracing particle paths in the flowing
ice body, and it does without artificial diffusion.</P>

<P>We compute the age field for the Antarctic ice sheet with both
methods for a time-dependent simulation driven
by a 242200 year surface temperature history derived from stable
isotope data of the Vostok deep ice core, and discuss the differences
of the age computation schemes. Emphasis is put on two regions:
(i) western Dronning Maud Land (DML), where reconnaissance for a deep
ice core within the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA)
is currently carried out, and (ii) the eastern part of
central East Antarctica with the
deep-ice-core locations Vostok and Dome C (the former completed, the
latter currently drilled within EPICA). The Eulerian
scheme provides good results except for the lower parts of the ice sheet
where the numerical diffusion falsifies the computed ages. The particle-tracing
scheme does not show this shortcoming; however, it yields ages generally
somewhat too small because it does not yet account for the time-dependence
of the ice flow.</P>
