<P>The dynamics and thermodynamics of the vicinity of Summit, the highest
point of the Greenland ice sheet at 72°34'N,
37°38'W, is simulated over two climate cycles until
the present with a high-resolution regional model coupled to a
large-scale model of the entire Greenland ice sheet. For the
computation of the age of ice, two different methods are applied, an
Eulerian scheme which solves the advective age equation in a frame
fixed in space and requires some artificial diffusion, and a
Lagrangian particle-tracing scheme which follows the motion of ice
particles and is diffusion-free. The transient simulation is based on
the shallow-ice approximation which neglects normal stress deviators
and shear stresses in vertical planes. For the simulated modern ice
sheet, the velocity and stress fields are then re-computed in the
Summit region by a first-order algorithm which includes these
stresses. The measured ice topography as well as the temperature profiles
of the boreholes GRIP and GISP2 are reproduced very well. The simulated
Summit motion of 16 ice thicknesses during the last 250,000 years
gives a clue for understanding the
origin of irregularities observed in the GRIP and GISP2 cores. In a
50 km region around Summit, all stresses are of the same
order of magnitude, so that a very precise modelling of the ice dynamics,
which is necessary for an accurate ice-core dating, requires that
the shallow-ice approximation be locally abandoned.</P>
