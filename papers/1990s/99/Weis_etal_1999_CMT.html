Theory of shallow ice shelves</H2>

<H4 style="color:#000000;">Abstract</H4>

<P>Ice shelves consist of two layers, an upper
layer of meteoric ice nourished by precipitation and flow from
the connected inland ice,
and a lower layer of marine ice that is built by the melting and
freezing processes at the ice-ocean interface and
the accretion of frazil ice from the underlying ocean.
The governing thermomechanical equations in the two layers are
formulated as are the boundary and transition conditions
that apply at the free surface, the material interface between the
meteoric and the marine ice and the ice-ocean interface. The equations
comprise in the bulk mass balances for the ice and the salt water
(in marine ice), momentum balance and energy balance equations, and at
the boundaries kinematic equations as well as jump conditions of
mass, momentum and energy. The side boundary conditions involve a
prescription of the mass flow along the grounding line from the inland
ice and a kinematic law describing the mass loss by calving along the
floating ice-shelf front. An appropriate scaling, in which the shallowness
of the ice shelves is used, gives rise to the development of a
perturbation scheme for the solution of the three-dimensional
equations. Its lowest-order approximation - the shallow-shelf
approximation (SSA) - shows the ice flow to be predominantly horizontal with a
velocity field independent of depth, but strongly depth-dependent
temperature and stress distributions.  This zeroth order
shallow-shelf approximation excludes the treatment of ice rumples, ice
rises and the vicinity of the grounding line, but higher-order
equations may to within second-order accuracy in the perturbation
parameter accommodate for these more complicated effects. The scaling
introduced finally leads to a vertically integrated system of non-linear
partial integro-differential equations describing the ice flow and evolution
equation for temperature and the free surfaces.</P>
