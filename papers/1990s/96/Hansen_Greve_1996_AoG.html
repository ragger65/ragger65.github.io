Polythermal modelling of steady states of the Antarctic ice sheet in
comparison with the real world</H2>

<P>An approach to simulate the present Antarctic ice sheet with
respect to its thermomechanical behaviour and the resulting features is made with
the 3-d polythermal ice sheet model designed by Greve and Hutter. It
treats zones of cold and temperate ice as different materials with their own
properties and dynamics. This is important because an underlying layer of
temperate ice can influence the ice sheet as a whole, as e.g. the cold ice may
slide upon the less viscous binary ice-water mixture.</P>

<P>Measurements indicate that the geothermal heat flux below the
Antarctic ice sheet appears to be remarkably higher than the standard
value of 42 mW/m2 that is usually applied for precambrian shields in
ice sheet modelling. Since the extent of temperate ice at the base is
highly dependent on this heat input from the lithosphere, an adequate
choice is crucial for realistic simulations. We shall present a series
of steady state results with varied geothermal heat flux and
demonstrate that the real ice sheet topography can be reproduced
fairly well with a value in the range of 50-60 mW/m2. Hereby, the
physical parameters of ice (especially the enhancement factor in
Glen's flow law) as used by Greve (1995) for polythermal Greenland ice
sheet simulations can be adopted without any change.  The remaining
disagreements may be explained by the neglected influence of the ice
shelves, the rather coarse horizontal resolution 100 km), the steady
state assumption and possible shortcomings in the parametrization of
the surface mass balance.</P>
