<P>A series of benchmark experiments are presented designed for testing and
comparing numerical ice sheet models. Following the outcome of two
EISMINT workshops organized for this purpose, model experiments are described
for ice sheets under fixed margin as well as under moving margin conditions.
These address both steady-state and time-dependent behaviour under schematic
boundary conditions and with prescribed physics. The emphasis is on numerical
aspects and on comparing results in situations where analytical solutions do
not exist. Most of the large-scale ice-sheet models currently in operation
were subjected to these tests, and a comparison was made of basic geophysical
variables such as ice thickness, velocity and temperature. Here we present
the consensus results which emerged, thereby providing reference solutions
against which the accuracy and consistency of ice-sheet modeling codes can
be assessed.</P>
