<P>Ice sheet modelling is an essential tool for estimating the effect of
climate change on the Greenland ice sheet. The large spatial and
long-term temporal scale of ice sheet models limits the amount of data
which can be used to test model results. The geological record is
useful because it provides test material on the time scales typical
for the memory of ice sheets (millennia). This paper compares modelled
ice margin positions with a geological scenario of ice margin
positions since the Last Glacial Maximum to the present in west
Greenland. Morphological evidence of ice margin positions is provided
by moraines. Moraine systems are dated by C14-dated marine shells and
terrestrial peat. Three Greenland ice sheet models are compared. There
are distinct differences in modelled ice margin positions between the
models and between model results and the geological
record. Disagreement between models and the geological record in the
near-coastal area is explained by the insufficient treatment of
marginal processes in a tidewater environment. A smaller than present
ice sheet around the warm period in the Holocene (Holocene climatic
optimum) only occurs if such a period appears in the forcing (ice core
record) or used temporal resolution. Smoothing of the GRIP record with
a 2000 year average eliminates the climatic signal related to the
Holocene climatic optimum. This underlines the importance of
short-term and medium-term variations (decades, centuries) in climatic
variables in determining ice margin positions, in the past, but also
in the future.</P>
