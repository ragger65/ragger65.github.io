<P>Boundary waves often form at the interface between ice and fluid flowing
adjacent to it, such as ripples under river ice covers, and steps on the bed
of supraglacial meltwater channels. They may also be formed by wind, such as
the megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet. Spiral troughs on the polar ice
caps of Mars have been interpreted to be cyclic steps formed by katabatic
wind blowing over ice. Cyclic steps are relatives of upstream-migrating
antidunes. Cyclic step formation on ice is not only a mechanical but also
a thermodynamic process. There have been very few studies on the formation
of either cyclic steps or upstream-migrating antidunes on ice. In this study,
we performed flume experiments to reproduce cyclic steps on ice by flowing
water, and found that trains of steps form when the Froude number is larger
than unity. The features of those steps allow them to be identified as ice-bed
analogs of cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers. We performed a linear
stability analysis and obtained a physical explanation of the formation of
upstream-migrating antidunes, i.e., precursors of cyclic steps. We compared
the results of experiments with the predictions of the analysis and found the
observed steps fall in the range where the analysis predicts interfacial
instability. We also found that short antidune-like undulations formed as a
precursor to the appearance of well-defined steps. This fact suggests that
such antidune-like undulations correspond to the instability predicted by
the analysis and are precursors of cyclic steps.</P>
