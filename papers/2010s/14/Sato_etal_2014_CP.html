<P>An ice core was retrieved in June 1998 from the Gorshkov
crater glacier at the top of the Ushkovsky volcano, in central
Kamchatka. This ice core is one of only two recovered from
Kamchatka so far, thus filling a gap in the regional instrumental
climate network. Hydrogen isotope (&delta;D) analyses and
past accumulation reconstructions were conducted for the top
140.7&nbsp;m of the core, spanning 1736-1997. Two accumulation
reconstruction methods were developed and applied with the Salamatin
and the Elmer/Ice firn-ice dynamics models, revealing a slightly increasing
or nearly stable trend, respectively. Wavelet analysis shows that
the ice core records have significant decadal and multi-decadal
variabilities at different times. Around 1880 the multi-decadal variability
of &delta;D became lost and its average value increased by 6&permil;.
The multi-decadal variability of reconstructed accumulation rates changed
at around 1850. Reconstructed accumulation variations agree with ages of
moraines in Kamchatka. Ice core signals were significantly correlated with
North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and surface temperature
(2&nbsp;m temperature). &delta;D correlates with the North Pacific Gyre
Oscillation (NPGO) index after the climate regime shift in 1976/1977,
but not before that. Therefore, our findings imply that the ice core record
contains various information on the local, regional and large-scale climate
variability in the North Pacific region. Understanding all detailed
mechanisms behind the time-dependent connections between these climate
patterns is challenging and requires further efforts towards multi-proxy
analysis and climate modelling.</P>
