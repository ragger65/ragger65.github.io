<P>The Tibetan Plateau is a topographic feature of extraordinary dimension
and has an important impact on regional and global climate. However, the glacial
history of the Tibetan Plateau is more poorly constrained than that of most other formerly
glaciated regions such as in North America and Eurasia. On the basis of some
field evidence it has been hypothesized that the Tibetan Plateau was covered by an
ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Abundant field- and chronological
evidence for a predominance of local valley glaciation during the past 300,000 calendar
years (that is, 300&nbsp;ka), coupled to an absence of glacial landforms and sediments in
extensive areas of the plateau, now refute this concept. This, furthermore, calls into
question previous ice sheet modeling attempts which generally arrive at ice volumes
considerably larger than allowed for by field evidence. Surprisingly, the robustness of
such numerical ice sheet model results has not been widely queried, despite potentially
important climate ramifications.We simulated the growth and decay of ice on
the Tibetan Plateau during the last 125&nbsp;ka in response to a large ensemble of
climate forcings (90 members) derived from Global Circulation Models (GCMs), using
a similar 3D thermomechanical ice sheet model as employed in previous studies. The
numerical results include as extreme end members as an ice-free Tibetan Plateau and
a plateau-scale ice sheet comparable, in volume, to the contemporary Greenland ice
sheet. We further demonstrate that numerical simulations that acceptably conform
to published reconstructions of Quaternary ice extent on the Tibetan Plateau cannot
be achieved with the employed stand-alone ice sheet model when merely forced by
paleoclimates derived from currently available GCMs. Progress is, however, expected
if future investigations employ ice sheet models with higher resolution, bidirectional
ice sheet-atmosphere feedbacks, improved treatment of the surface mass balance, and
regional climate data and climate reconstructions.</P>
