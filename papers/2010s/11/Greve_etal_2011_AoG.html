<P>SeaRISE (Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) is a US-led multi-model
community effort to predict the likely range of the contribution of the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets to sea-level rise over the next few hundred years under global warming conditions.
The Japanese ice-sheet modelling community is contributing to SeaRISE with two large-scale,
dynamic/thermodynamic models: SICOPOLIS and IcIES. Here we discuss results for
the Greenland ice sheet, obtained using both models under the forcings (surface temperature
and precipitation scenarios) defined by the SeaRISE effort. A crucial point for meaningful
simulations into the future is to obtain initial conditions that are close to the observed state
of the present-day ice sheet. This is achieved by proper tuning during model spin-up from
the last glacial/interglacial cycle to today. Experiments over 500 years indicate that both
models are more sensitive (exhibit a larger rate of ice-sheet mass loss) to future climate
warming (based on the A1B emission scenario) than to a doubling in the basal sliding speed.
Ice-sheet mass loss varies between the two models by a factor of ~2 for sliding experiments
and a factor of ~3 for climate-warming experiments, highlighting the importance of improved
constraints on the parameterization of basal sliding and surface mass balance in ice-sheet models.</P>
