<P>Since the late 1970s, numerical modelling has become
established as an important technique for the understanding of
ice sheet and glacier dynamics, and a number of models have
been developed over the years. Ice sheet models are
particularly relevant for predicting the possible response of
ice sheets to climate change. Recent observations suggest that
ice dynamics could play a crucial role for the contribution of
ice sheets to future sea level rise under global warming
conditions, and the need for further research into the matter
was explicitly stated in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). In this paper, we review the state of the art and
current problems of ice sheet and glacier modelling. An outline
of the underlying theory is given, and crucial processes (basal
sliding, calving, interaction with the solid Earth) are
discussed. We summarise recent progress in the development of
ice sheet and glacier system models and their coupling to
climate models, and point out directions for future work.</P>
