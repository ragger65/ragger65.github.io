<P>The Fourth IPCC Assessment Report concluded
that ice sheet flow models, in their current state, were unable
to provide accurate forecast for the increase of polar
ice sheet discharge and the associated contribution to sea
level rise. Since then, the glaciological community has undertaken
a huge effort to develop and improve a new generation
of ice flow models, and as a result a significant number
of new ice sheet models have emerged. Among them is the
parallel finite-element model Elmer/Ice, based on the open-source
multi-physics code Elmer. It was one of the first full-Stokes
models used to make projections for the evolution
of the whole Greenland ice sheet for the coming two centuries.
Originally developed to solve local ice flow problems
of high mechanical and physical complexity, Elmer/Ice has
today reached the maturity to solve larger-scale problems,
earning the status of an ice sheet model. Here, we summarise
almost 10&nbsp;yr of development performed by different groups.
Elmer/Ice solves the full-Stokes equations, for isotropic but
also anisotropic ice rheology, resolves the grounding line
dynamics as a contact problem, and contains various basal
friction laws. Derived fields, like the age of the ice, the
strain rate or stress, can also be computed. Elmer/Ice includes
two recently proposed inverse methods to infer badly
known parameters. Elmer is a highly parallelised code thanks
to recent developments and the implementation of a block
preconditioned solver for the Stokes system. In this paper, all
these components are presented in detail, as well as the numerical
performance of the Stokes solver and developments planned for
the future.</P>
