Resolution of ice streams and outlet glaciers in large-scale simulations
of the Greenland ice sheet</H2>

<H4 style="color:#000000;">Abstract</H4>

<P>The dynamic/thermodynamic shallow-ice model SICOPOLIS
is applied to the Greenland ice sheet. Paleoclimatic spin-ups
from 125&nbsp;ka&nbsp;BP until today, as well as future-climate
experiments 500 years into the future, are carried out with
three different grid spacings, namely 20, 10 and 5&nbsp;km. The
scenarios are a subset of those specified by the SeaRISE
(Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) community effort.
The bed topography includes improved troughs for Jakobshavn
Isbr&aelig;, Helheim, Kangerdlugssuaq and Petermann glaciers,
processed by an algorithm that preserves shape, orientation and
continuity of the troughs on the 5&nbsp;km scale. Comparison of
simulated and observed present-day surface velocities show that
these ice streams and outlet glaciers are resolved with
different accuracies, ranging from poor (20&nbsp;km grid) to
reasonably good (5&nbsp;km grid). In the future-climate
experiments, the simulated absolute ice volumes depend
significantly on the resolution, while the sensitivities
(ice volumes relative to the constant-climate control run)
vary only by a few centimeters of sea-level equivalent.</P>
