Comparison and verification of enthalpy schemes for polythermal

<P>The enthalpy method for the thermodynamics of polythermal glaciers and
ice sheets is tested and verified by a one-dimensional problem
(parallel-sided slab). The enthalpy method alone does not include
explicitly the transition conditions at the cold-temperate transition
surface (CTS) that separates the upper cold from the lower temperate
layer. However, these conditions are important for correctly determining
the position of the CTS. For the numerical solution of the polythermal
slab problem, we consider a two-layer front-tracking scheme as well as
three different one-layer schemes (conventional one-layer scheme,
one-layer melting CTS scheme, one-layer freezing CTS scheme). Computed
steady-state temperature and water-content profiles are verified with
exact solutions, and transient solutions computed by the one-layer
schemes are compared with those of the two-layer scheme, considered to
be a reliable reference. While the conventional one-layer scheme (that
does not include the transition conditions at the CTS) can produce
correct solutions for melting conditions at the CTS, it is more reliable
to enforce the transition conditions explicitly. For freezing
conditions, it is imperative to enforce them because the conventional
one-layer scheme cannot handle the associated discontinuities. The
suggested numerical schemes are suitable for implementation in
three-dimensional glacier and ice-sheet models.</P>
