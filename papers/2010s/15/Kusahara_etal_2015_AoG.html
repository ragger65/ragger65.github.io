<P>We estimate the sea-ice extent and basal melt of Antarctic ice
shelves at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using a coupled
ice-shelf&mdash;sea-ice&mdash;ocean model. The shape of Antarctic ice
shelves, ocean conditions and atmospheric surface conditions at the LGM
are different from those in the present day; these are derived from an
ice-shelf&mdash;ice-sheet model, a sea-ice&mdash;ocean model and a
climate model for glacial simulations, respectively. The winter sea ice
in the LGM is shown to extend up to ~7° of latitude further equatorward
than in the present day. For the LGM summer, the model shows extensive
sea-ice cover in the Atlantic sector and little sea ice in the other
sectors. These modelled sea-ice features are consistent with those
reconstructed from sea-floor sedimentary records. Total basal melt of
Antarctic ice shelves in the LGM was ~2147&nbsp;Gt/a, which is much
larger than the present-day value. More warm waters originating from
Circumpolar Deep Water could be easily transported into ice-shelf
cavities during the LGM because the full glacial grounding line
extended to shelf break regions and ice shelves overhung continental
slopes. This increased transport of warm water masses underneath an ice
shelf and into their basal cavities led to the high basal melt of ice
shelves in the LGM.</P>
