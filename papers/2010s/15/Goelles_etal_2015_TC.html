<P>Albedo is the dominant factor governing surface melt variability in the
ablation area of ice sheets and glaciers. Aerosols such as mineral dust and
black carbon (soot) accumulate on the ice surface and cause a darker surface
and therefore a lower albedo. The darkening effect on the ice surface is
currently not included in sea level projections, and the effect is unknown.
We present a model framework which includes ice dynamics, aerosol transport,
aerosol accumulation and the darkening effect on ice albedo and its
consequences for surface melt. The model is applied to a simplified geometry
resembling the conditions of the Greenland ice sheet, and it is forced by
several temperature scenarios to quantify the darkening effect of aerosols on
future mass loss. The effect of aerosols depends non-linearly on the
temperature rise due to the feedback between aerosol accumulation and surface
melt. According to our conceptual model, accounting for black carbon and dust
in future projections of ice sheet changes until the year 3000 could induce
an additional volume loss of 7%. Since we have ignored some feedback
processes, the impact might be even larger.</P>
