<P>Global warming, also referred to as climate change, is the observed
rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its
related effects. It is established scientific consensus that the
climate system is warming, and that human influence has been the
dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.
A major consequence of global warming is sea level rise, currently
occurring at a rate of 3.2&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;mm per year.
For the 21st century, the range predicted by the Fifth Assessment
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change across
different possible climate futures is between 0.26 metres and
0.82 metres. The largest source is thermal expansion of ocean water,
followed by melting/discharge of ice sheets, ice caps and glaciers.
In the long term, the two ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland are
the largest potential contributors to global sea level rise because of
their enormous amounts of stored water, together amounting to
~&nbsp;65 metres of sea level equivalent. The ice sheets are therefore
the focus of observational as well as modelling efforts.</P>
