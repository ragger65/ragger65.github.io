<P>Earlier large-scale Greenland ice sheet sea-level projections (e.g. those
run during the ice2sea and SeaRISE initiatives) have shown that ice sheet
initial conditions have a large effect on the projections and give rise to
important uncertainties. The goal of this initMIP-Greenland intercomparison
exercise is to compare, evaluate, and improve the initialisation techniques
used in the ice sheet modelling community and to estimate the associated
uncertainties in modelled mass changes. initMIP-Greenland is the first in a
series of ice sheet model intercomparison activities within ISMIP6 (the
Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6), which is the primary
activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
focusing on the ice sheets. Two experiments for the large-scale Greenland
ice sheet have been designed to allow intercomparison between participating
models of (1) the initial present-day state of the ice sheet and (2) the
response in two idealised forward experiments. The forward experiments serve
to evaluate the initialisation in terms of model drift (forward run without
additional forcing) and in response to a large perturbation (prescribed
surface mass balance anomaly); they should not be interpreted as sea-level
projections. We present and discuss results that highlight the diversity of
data sets, boundary conditions, and initialisation techniques used in the
community to generate initial states of the Greenland ice sheet. We find
good agreement across the ensemble for the dynamic response to surface mass
balance changes in areas where the simulated ice sheets overlap but
differences arising from the initial size of the ice sheet. The model drift
in the control experiment is reduced for models that participated in earlier
intercomparison exercises.</P>
