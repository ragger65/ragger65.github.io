<P> The largest uncertainty in projections of future sea-level change
still results from the potentially changing dynamical ice discharge from
Antarctica. While ice discharge can alter through a number of processes,
basal ice-shelf melting induced by a warming ocean has been identified as
a major if not the major cause for possible additional ice flow across
the grounding line. Here we derive dynamic ice-sheet response functions
for basal ice-shelf melting using experiments carried out within the
Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE) intercomparison
project with five different Antarctic ice-sheet models. As used here
these response functions provide separate contributions for four
different Antarctic drainage regions. Under the assumptions of
linear-response theory we project future ice-discharge for each model,
each region and each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways
(RCP) using oceanic temperatures from 19 comprehensive climate models of
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP-5, and two ocean models
from the EU project Ice2Sea. Uncertainty in the climatic forcing, the
oceanic response and the ice-model differences is combined into an
uncertainty range of future Antarctic ice discharge induced from basal
ice-shelf melt. The additional ice loss (Table&nbsp;6) is clearly
scenario-dependent and results in a median of 0.07&nbsp;m (66%-range:
0.04-0.10&nbsp;m; 90%-range: -0.01-0.26&nbsp;m) of global sea-level equivalent for
the low-emission RCP-2.6 scenario and yields 0.1&nbsp;m (66%-range:
0.06-0.14&nbsp;m; 90%-range: -0.01-0.45&nbsp;m) for the strongest RCP-8.5. If only models
with an explicit representation of ice shelves are taken into account the
scenario dependence remains and the values change to: 0.05&nbsp;m (66%-range:
0.03-0.08&nbsp;m) for RCP-2.6 and 0.07&nbsp;m (66%-range: 0.04-0.11&nbsp;m) for RCP-8.5.
These results were obtained using a time delay between the surface
warming signal and the subsurface oceanic warming as observed in the
CMIP-5 models. Without this time delay the ranges for all ice models
changes to 0.10&nbsp;m (66%-range: 0.07-0.12&nbsp;m; 90%-range: 0.01-0.28&nbsp;m) for
RCP-2.6 and 0.15&nbsp;m (66%-range: 0.10-0.21&nbsp;m; 90%-range: 0.02-0.53&nbsp;m) for
RCP-8.5. All probability distributions as provided in Fig.&nbsp;10 are highly
skewed towards high values.</P>
