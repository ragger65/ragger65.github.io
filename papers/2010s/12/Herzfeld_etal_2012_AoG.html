<P>Prediction of future changes in dynamics of the Earth's ice sheets,
mass loss and resultant contribution to sea-level rise are the main
objectives of ice-sheet modeling. Mass transfer from ice sheet to ocean
is, in large part, through outlet glaciers. Subglacial topography plays
an important role in ice dynamics; however, trough systems have not
been included in bed digital elevation models (DEMS) used in modeling,
because their size is close to the model resolution. Using recently
collected CReSIS MCoRDs data of subglacial topography and an algorithm
that allows topographically and morphologically correct integration of
troughs and trough systems at anymodeling scale (5&nbsp;km resolution
for SeaRISE), an improved Greenland bed DEM was developed that includes
Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim, Kangerdlussuaq and Petermann glaciers
(JakHelKanPet DEM). Contrasting the different responses of two
Greenland ice-sheet models (UMISM and SICOPOLIS) to the more accurately
represented bed shows significant differences in modeled surface
velocity, basal water production and ice thickness. Consequently,
modeled ice volumes for the Greenland ice sheet are significantly
smaller using the JakHelKanPet DEM, and volume losses larger. More
generally, the study demonstrates the role of spatial modeling of data
specifically as input for dynamic ice-sheet models in assessments of
future sea-level rise.</P>
