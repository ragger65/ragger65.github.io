<P>In this contribution we model flow-induced anisotropy of polar
ice in order to gain a better understanding for the underlying
microstructure and its influence on the deformation process. In
particular, a continuum-mechanical, anisotropic flow model that
is based on an anisotropic flow enhancement factor (CAFFE
model) is applied. The polycrystalline ice is regarded as a
mixture whose grains are characterized by their orientation.
The approach is based on two distinct scales: the underlying
microstructure influences the macroscopic material behavior and
is taken into account phenomenologically. To achieve this, the
orientation mass density is introduced as a mesoscopic field,
i.e. it depends on a mesoscopic variable (the orientation) in
addition to position and time. The classical flow law of Glen
is extended by a scalar, but anisotropic enhancement factor.
Four different effects (local rigid body rotation, grain
rotation, rotation recrystallization, grain boundary migration)
influencing the evolution of the grain orientations are taken
into account. All modeling parameters are either measurable in
or derivable from field observations or laboratory experiments.
A finite volume method is chosen for the discretization
procedure. Numerical results simulating the ice flow at the
site of the EPICA ice core in Dronning Maud Land (referred to
as EDML), Antarctica, are presented. They go beyond earlier
results by Seddik et&nbsp;al. (<i>J. Glaciol.</i> 2008;
<b>54</b>(187):631-642) in which only local
rigid body rotation and grain rotation were accounted for.
By comparing simulated and observed fabrics, we come up with
reference values for the parameters in the constitutive
equations for rotation recrystallization and grain boundary
migration. Down to 2045&nbsp;m depth, good agreement can be
achieved; however, further down the observed fabric cannot be
reproduced well due to numerical issues. Additionally, we study
the influence of the two superposed deformation regimes of
vertical compression and simple shear separately and
demonstrate that the numerical problems are due to the
predominant shear regime near the bottom, whereas vertical
compression only produces stable results everywhere.</P>
