<P>Over the last two decades, the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has been
losing mass at an increasing rate, enhancing its contribution to
sea-level rise (SLR). The recent increases in ice loss appear to be
due to changes in both the surface mass balance of the ice sheet and
ice discharge (ice flux to the ocean). Rapid ice flow directly
affects the discharge, but also alters ice-sheet geometry and so
affects climate and surface mass balance. Present-day ice-sheet
models only represent rapid ice flow in an approximate fashion and,
as a consequence, have never explicitly addressed the role of ice
discharge on the total GrIS mass balance, especially at the scale of
individual outlet glaciers. Here, we present a new-generation
prognostic ice-sheet model which reproduces the current patterns of
rapid ice flow. This requires three essential developments: the
complete solution of the full system of equations governing ice
deformation; a variable resolution unstructured mesh to resolve
outlet glaciers and the use of inverse methods to better constrain
poorly known parameters using observations. The modelled ice
discharge is in good agreement with observations on the continental
scale and for individual outlets. From this initial state, we
investigate possible bounds for the next century ice-sheet mass loss.
We run sensitivity experiments of the GrIS dynamical response to
perturbations in climate and basal lubrication, assuming a fixed
position of the marine termini. We find that increasing ablation
tends to reduce outflow and thus decreases the ice-sheet imbalance.
In our experiments, the GrIS initial mass (im)balance is preserved
throughout the whole century in the absence of reinforced forcing,
allowing us to estimate a lower bound of 75&nbsp;mm for the GrIS
contribution to SLR by 2100. In one experiment, we show that the
current increase in the rate of ice loss can be reproduced and
maintained throughout the whole century. However, this requires a
very unlikely perturbation of basal lubrication. From this result we
are able to estimate an upper bound of 140&nbsp;mm from dynamics only
for the GrIS contribution to SLR by 2100.</P>
