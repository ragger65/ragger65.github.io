<P>Ice-sheet modelling is an important tool for predicting the possible response of ice sheets
to climate change in the past and future. An established ice-sheet model is SICOPOLIS (SImulation
COde for POLythermal Ice Sheets), and for this study the previously grounded-ice-only model was
complemented by an ice-shelf module. The new version of SICOPOLIS is applied to the Antarctic ice
sheet, driven by standard forcings defined by the SeaRISE (Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution)
community effort. A crucial point for simulations into the future is to obtain reasonable initial conditions
by a palaeoclimatic spin-up, which we carry out over 125000 years from the Eemian until today. We
then carry out a set of experiments for 500 years into the future, in which the surface temperature and
precipitation are kept at their present-day distributions, while sub-ice-shelf melting rates between 0 and
200&nbsp;m/a are applied. These simulations show a significant, but not catastrophic, sensitivity of the ice
sheet. Grounded-ice volumes decrease with increasing melting rates, and the spread of the results from
the zero to the maximum melting case is ~0.65&nbsp;m&nbsp;s.l.e. (metres sea-level equivalent) after
100 years and ~2.25&nbsp;m&nbsp;s.l.e. after 500 years.</P>
