<P>This study analyzes the uncertainties in the models of the Greenland Ice
Sheet (GIS) that arise from ill-constrained geothermal heat flux (GHF)
distribution. Within the context of dynamic GIS modeling, we consider the
following questions: (i) What is the significance of the differences between
the existing GHF models for the GIS modeling studies? (ii) How well does the
modeled GIS controlled by the GHF models agree with the observational data?
(iii) What are the relative contributions of uncertainties in GHF and climate
forcing to the misfit between the observed and modeled present-day GIS? The
results of paleoclimatic simulations suggest that differences in the GHF models
have a major effect on the history and resulting present-day state of the GIS.
The ice sheet model controlled by any of these GHF forcings reproduces the
observed GIS state to only a limited degree and fails to reproduce either the
topography or the low basal temperatures measured in southern Greenland. By
contrast, the simulation controlled by a simple spatially uniform GHF forcing
results in a considerably better fit with the observations, raising questions
about the use of the three GHF models within the framework of GIS modeling.
Sensitivity tests reveal that the misfit between the modeled and measured
temperatures in central Greenland is mostly due to inaccurate GHF and Wisconsin
precipitation forcings. The failure of the ice sheet model in southern
Greenland, however, is mainly caused by inaccuracies in the surface temperature
forcing and the generally overestimated GHF values suggested by all GHF
models.</P>
