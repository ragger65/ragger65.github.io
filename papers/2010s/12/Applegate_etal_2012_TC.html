<P>Lack of knowledge about the values of ice sheet model input parameters introduces
substantial uncertainty into projections of Greenland Ice Sheet contributions to future sea
level rise. Computer models of ice sheet behavior provide one of several means of estimating
future sea level rise due to mass loss from ice sheets. Such models have many input
parameters whose values are not well known. Recent studies have investigated the effects of
these parameters on model output, but the range of potential future sea level increases due to
model parametric uncertainty has not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that this
range is large, using a 100-member perturbed-physics ensemble with the SICOPOLIS ice
sheet model. Each model run is spun up over 125000&nbsp;yr using geological forcings and
subsequently driven into the future using an asymptotically increasing air temperature
anomaly curve. All modeled ice sheets lose mass after 2005&nbsp;AD. Parameters controlling
surface melt dominate the model response to temperature change. After culling the ensemble
to include only members that give reasonable ice volumes in 2005&nbsp;AD, the range of projected
sea level rise values in 2100&nbsp;AD is ~40% or more of the median. Data on past ice sheet
behavior can help reduce this uncertainty, but none of our ensemble members produces a
reasonable ice volume change during the mid-Holocene, relative to the present. This problem
suggests that the model's exponential relation between temperature and precipitation does not
hold during the Holocene, or that the central-Greenland temperature forcing curve used to
drive the model is not representative of conditions around the ice margin at this time (among
other possibilities). Our simulations also lack certain observed physical processes that may
tend to enhance the real ice sheet's response. Regardless, this work has implications for other
studies that use ice sheet models to project or hindcast the behavior of the Greenland Ice
Sheet.</P>
