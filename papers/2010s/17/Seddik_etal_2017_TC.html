<P>A hierarchy of approximations of the force balance for the flow
of grounded ice exists, ranging from the most sophisticated full Stokes
(FS) formulation to the most simplified shallow ice approximation (SIA).
Both are implemented in the ice flow model Elmer/Ice, and we compare
them by applying the model to the East Antarctic Shirase drainage basin.
First, we apply the control inverse method to infer the distribution of
basal friction with FS. We then compare FS and SIA by simulating the
flow of the drainage basin under present-day conditions and for three
scenarios 100 years into the future defined by the SeaRISE (Sea-level
Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) project. FS reproduces the observed
flow pattern of the drainage basin well, in particular the zone of fast
flow near the grounding line, while SIA generally overpredicts the
surface velocities. As for the transient scenarios, the ice volume
change (relative to the constant-climate control run) of the surface
climate experiment is nearly the same for FS and SIA, while for the
basal sliding experiment (halved basal friction), the ice volume change
is ~30% larger for SIA than for FS. This confirms findings of earlier
studies that, in order to model ice sheet areas containing ice streams
and outlet glaciers with high resolution and precision, careful
consideration must be given to the choice of a suitable force
balance.</P>
