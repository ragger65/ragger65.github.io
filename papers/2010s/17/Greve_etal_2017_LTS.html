<P>Numerical modelling has become established as an important tool
for understanding ice sheet dynamics in general, and in particular
for assessing the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets to future sea level change under global warming conditions.
In this paper, we review related work carried out with the ice sheet
model SICOPOLIS (SImulation COde for POLythermal Ice Sheets). As part
of a group of eight models, it was applied to a set of standardised
experiments for the Greenland ice sheet defined by the SeaRISE
(Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) initiative. A main finding
of SeaRISE was that, if climate change continues unabatedly, the ice
sheet may experience a significant decay over the next centuries.
However, the spread of results across different models was very large,
mainly because of differences in the applied initialisation methods
and surface mass balance schemes. Therefore, the new initiative ISMIP6
(Ice Sheet Modeling Intercomparison Project for CMIP6) was launched.
An early sub-project is InitMIP-Greenland, within which we showed that
two different initialisations computed with SICOPOLIS lead indeed to
large differences in the simulated response to schematic future
climate scenarios. Further work within ISMIP6 will thus focus on
improved initialisation techniques. Based on this, refined future
climate simulations for the Greenland ice sheet, driven by forcings
derived from AOGCM (atmosphere-ocean general circulation model)
simulations, will be carried out. The goal of ISMIP6 is to provide
significantly improved estimates of ice sheet contribution to sea
level rise in the coming years.</P>
