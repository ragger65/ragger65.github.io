<P>The shallow ice approximation (SIA) is commonly used in ice-sheet
models to simplify the force balance equations within the ice. However,
the SIA cannot adequately reproduce the dynamics of the fast flowing
ice streams usually found at the margins of ice sheets. To overcome
this limitation, recent studies have introduced heuristic hybrid
combinations of the SIA and the shelfy stream approximation. Here, we
implement four different hybrid schemes into a model of the Antarctic
Ice Sheet in order to compare their performance under present-day
conditions. For each scheme, the model is calibrated using an iterative
technique to infer the spatial variability in basal sliding parameters.
Model results are validated against topographic and velocity data. Our
analysis shows that the iterative technique compensates for the
differences between the schemes, producing similar ice-sheet
configurations through quantitatively different results of the sliding
coefficient calibration. Despite this we observe a robust agreement in
the reconstructed patterns of basal sliding parameters. We exchange the
calibrated sliding parameter distributions between the schemes to
demonstrate that the results of the model calibration cannot be
straightforwardly transferred to models based on different
approximations of ice dynamics. However, easily adaptable calibration
techniques for the potential distribution of basal sliding coefficients
can be implemented into ice models to overcome such incompatibility, as
shown in this study.</P>
