Marine ice sheet model performance depends on basal sliding physics
and sub-shelf melting</H2>

<P>Computer models are necessary for understanding and predicting
marine ice sheet behaviour. However, there is uncertainty over
implementation of physical processes at the ice base, both for
grounded and floating glacial ice. Here we implement several sliding
relations in a marine ice sheet flow-line model accounting for all
stress components and demonstrate that model resolution requirements
are strongly dependent on both the choice of basal sliding relation
and the spatial distribution of ice shelf basal melting.</P>

<P>Sliding relations that reduce the magnitude of the step change in
basal drag from grounded ice to floating ice (where basal drag is set
to zero) show reduced dependence on resolution compared to a commonly
used relation, in which basal drag is purely a power law function of
basal ice velocity. Sliding relations in which basal drag goes smoothly
to zero as the grounding line is approached from inland (due to a
physically motivated incorporation of effective pressure at the bed)
provide further reduction in resolution dependence.</P>

<P>A similar issue is found with the imposition of basal melt under the
floating part of the ice shelf: melt parameterisations that reduce the
abruptness of change in basal melting from grounded ice (where basal
melt is set to zero) to floating ice provide improved convergence with
resolution compared to parameterisations in which high melt occurs
adjacent to the grounding line.</P>

<P>Thus physical processes, such as sub-glacial outflow (which could
cause high melt near the grounding line), impact on capability to
simulate marine ice sheets. If there exists an abrupt change across
the grounding line in either basal drag or basal melting, then high
resolution will be required to solve the problem. However, the
plausible combination of a physical dependency of basal drag on
effective pressure, and the possibility of low ice shelf basal melt
rates next to the grounding line, may mean that some marine ice sheet
systems can be reliably simulated at a coarser resolution than
currently thought necessary.</P>
