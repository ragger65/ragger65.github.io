<P>Ice originating near the inland ice divide of the ice sheet can reappear
as marginal ice at the surface near the ice terminal in the ablation area.
We have analyzed delta-18-O values and ion concentrations of the Skallen,
Skarvsnes and Hamna terminal ice sections, located along the estuary line in
the S&ocirc;ya drainage basin, East Antarctica. The data suggest that the
upper part of the Skallen terminal ice section could have originated from
inland precipitation on the Shirase drainage basin during marine isotope
stage (MIS) 5e, while the upper part of Skarvsnes and Hamna terminal ice
sections could have originated from inland precipitation on the S&ocirc;ya
drainage basin. We calculate past elevation maps for the Antarctic ice
sheet using the three-dimensional model SICOPOLIS. This model suggests
that the upstream portion of the S&ocirc;ya drainage basin during the
glacial period (MIS&nbsp;2, 3 or&nbsp;4) was located to the northeast of
its present location. A flow history is proposed wherein ice from the
inland Shirase drainage area flowed over the present ice-divide line from
the Shirase to the S&ocirc;ya drainage basin during the glacial period. The
ice in the S&ocirc;ya drainage basin then flowed to the marginal part of
the sheet after the ice divide had assumed its present position.</P>
