<P>The Mars Atmosphere-Ice Coupler MAIC-2 is a simple, latitudinal
model, which consists of a set of parameterisations for the surface
temperature, the atmospheric water transport and the surface mass
balance (condensation minus evaporation) of water ice. It is driven
directly by the orbital parameters obliquity, eccentricity and solar
longitude (Ls) of perihelion. Surface temperature is described by the
Local Insolation Temperature (LIT) scheme, which uses a daily and
latitude-dependent radiation balance. The evaporation rate of water
is calculated by an expression for free convection, driven by density
differences between water vapor and ambient air, the condensation
rate follows from the assumption that any water vapour which exceeds
the local saturation pressure condenses instantly, and atmospheric
transport of water vapour is approximated by instantaneous mixing.
Glacial flow of ice deposits is neglected. Simulations with constant
orbital parameters show that low obliquities favour deposition of
ice in high latitudes and vice versa. A transient scenario driven
by a computed history of orbital parameters over the last
10&nbsp;million years produces essentially monotonically growing
polar ice deposits during the most recent 4&nbsp;million years, and
a very good agreement with the observed present-day polar layered
deposits. The thick polar deposits sometimes continue in thin ice
deposits which extend far into the mid latitudes, which confirms
the idea of "ice ages" at high obliquity. </P>
