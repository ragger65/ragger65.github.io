<P>Results from the Heinrich Event INtercOmparison
(HEINO) topic of the Ice-Sheet Model Intercomparison Project
(ISMIP) are presented. ISMIP HEINO was designed to explore
internal large-scale ice-sheet instabilities in different
contemporary ice-sheet models. These instabilities are of
interest because they are a possible cause of Heinrich
events. A simplified geometry experiment reproduces the main
characteristics of the Laurentide ice sheet, including the
sedimented region over Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. The model
experiments include a standard run plus seven variations.
Nine dynamic/thermodynamic ice-sheet models were investigated;
one of these models contains a combination of the shallow-shelf
(SSA) and shallow-ice approximation (SIA), while the remaining
eight models are of SIA type only. Seven models, including the
SIA-SSA model, exhibit oscillatory surges with a period of
~1000&nbsp;years for a broad range of parameters, while two
models remain in a permanent state of streaming for most
parameter settings. In a number of models, the oscillations
disappear for high surface temperatures, strong snowfall and
small sediment sliding parameters. In turn, low surface
temperatures and low snowfall are favourable for the ice-surge
cycles. We conclude that further improvement of ice-sheet models
is crucial for adequate, robust simulations of cyclic
large-scale instabilities.</P>
