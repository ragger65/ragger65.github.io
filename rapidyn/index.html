<h1>Simulation of rapid dynamical changes of the
    Greenland ice sheet in response to global warming</h1>

<p>The Greenland ice sheet is the second-largest land ice mass on the present-day
earth, and its volume amounts to approx. 7.3&nbsp;metres of sea level equivalent.
The current mass balance of the ice sheet is most likely negative with an accelerating
trend, even though the uncertainty is still significant. Surface melting
increases strongly with rising surface temperatures, which makes the ice sheet very
susceptible to future global warming. In addition, recent observations have led to
strong concerns that ice-dynamical processes (basal sliding accelerated by surface
meltwater, speed-up of ice streams and outlet glaciers) may boost the decay and thus
lead to an additional contribution to sea level rise.
</p>

<p>In this project, the model Elmer/Ice, which is based on the open-source
finite element software package <A HREF="http://www.csc.fi/elmer">Elmer</A>
and solves the full Stokes equations for glacial flow,
was set up for the Greenland ice sheet. A new finite element
mesh with a highly refined resolution in the critical areas of the major ice
streams (Jakobshavn Ice Stream, North-East Greenland Ice Stream, Kangerdlugssuaq
Glacier and Helheim Glacier) was created. Simulations were conducted from the present
until 100 years into the future for the standardized scenarios provided by the
SeaRISE community effort ("Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution";
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/srise-lanl">http://tinyurl.com/srise-lanl</A>,
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/srise-umt">http://tinyurl.com/srise-umt</A>).
For comparison, the same experiments were also run with the shallow ice model
<A HREF="http://sicopolis.greveweb.net/">SICOPOLIS</A>.
We found that the sensitivities of the models Elmer/Ice and SICOPOLIS
are similar for the direct global warming scenario (ice sheet response
mainly due to more negative surface mass balance), while the sensitivity of
Elmer/Ice is about 3 times smaller than that of SICOPOLIS for the ice-dynamic
scenario (doubled basal sliding assumed). We have submitted the results to the
SeaRISE coordinators for being included in the multi-model assessment.
