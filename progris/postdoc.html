<h2>Job description</h2>

<p>Of all ice bodies on Earth, the Greenland ice sheet will likely contribute
most to global sea level rise over the next decades and centuries.
"Projecting discharge from the Greenland ice sheet using climatic forcings
derived from atmosphere-ocean models" (ProGrIS, PI: Professor 
<A HREF="http://wwwice.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/~greve/">Ralf Greve</A>)
is a research project funded by the
<A HREF="http://www.jsps.go.jp/"> Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science (JSPS)</A> with the objective to assess this contribution, based on
atmosphere-ocean and ice sheet modelling. ProGrIS is closely linked to the
international
<A HREF="http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/activities/targeted/ismip6">ISMIP6</A>
initiative and the Japanese <A HREF="http://www.arcs-pro.jp/">ArCS</A>
project.</P>

<P>The main task of the position is to
carry out numerical simulations of the ice dynamics and mass balance of the
Greenland ice sheet with the ice sheet model
<A HREF="http://www.sicopolis.net/">SICOPOLIS</A>, forced by climate scenarios
for the recent past and the future. Spin-ups in order to provide suitable
initial conditions for these simulations must also be conducted. Desirable
model improvements include schemes for basal hydrology, ice stream dynamics,
implementation of new DEMs (digital elevation models) for the ice surface and
bed, and program optimisation (numerical techniques, computing speed).
Emphasis can be placed depending on individual interest.
Cooperation with the domestic and international
project partners is required, and dissemination of results in the form of
peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences is
expected.</p>

<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>Candidates should hold a PhD/doctoral degree in 
environmental/atmospheric/cryospheric sciences, oceanography,
physics, geophysics or related natural sciences.
Experience in numerical modelling with finite differences,
good computer programming skills (preferably in Fortran) 
and a reasonable command of oral and written English are a prerequisite.</p>

<h2>Offer</h2>

<p>The candidate is offered a full-time position for an initial period 
from 1 October 2017 (negotiable) until 31 March 2018. The position can be
extended by 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 year until 31 March 2020.</p>

<p>The gross salary is JPY 3,600,000 per year (JPY 300,000 per month, to be
paid on the 17th every month).
A commuting allowance can be provided depending on circumstances.
Social insurances include health insurance, a pension plan, unemployment
insurance and workers' accident insurance.</P>

<h2>About the institute</h2>

<p>The position is based at <A HREF="http://www.hokudai.ac.jp/">Hokkaido
University</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/">Institute of Low
Temperature Science</A> (ILTS) in Sapporo, Japan. ILTS was founded in 1941
as the first research institute affiliated with Hokkaido University. Since
the latest reorganisation in 2008, ILTS is composed of three research divisions
(Frontier Ice and Snow Science, Water and Material Cycles,
Environmental Biology), a Joint Research Division and the
Pan-Okhotsk Research Center. ILTS is approved by
<A HREF="http://www.mext.go.jp/">MEXT</A> as a national Joint Use/Research
Center and promotes comprehensive research of various natural phenomena
occurring in the cryosphere and cold environments.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will join the 
<A HREF="http://wwwice.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/"> Glacier and Ice Sheet Research
Group</A> of ILTS's Frontier Ice and Snow Science Division.</p>
